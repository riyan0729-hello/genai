  - Input validation and error handling
  - Cross-browser compatibility testing
  - Docker container functionality
  - Performance testing (10-second generation requirement)

### 6. Finalization Phase
- **Objective**: Deploy application and prepare comprehensive documentation
- **Final Activities**:
  - Production deployment setup
  - Documentation preparation
  - User manual creation
  - Project presentation materials
